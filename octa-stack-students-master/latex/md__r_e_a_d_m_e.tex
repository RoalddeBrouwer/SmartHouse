\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Architecture}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
The architecture of the octa-\/stack consists of three main parts being the \href{\#core}{\texttt{ core}}, \href{\#shields}{\texttt{ shields}} and \href{\#applications}{\texttt{ applications}}.

\textbackslash{} {\itshape octa-\/stack architecture}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{core}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The core of the stack consists of some common \href{\#drivers}{\texttt{ drivers}}, support for different \href{\#platforms}{\texttt{ platforms}} and platform independent \href{\#st}{\texttt{ ST}} code.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{drivers}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The drivers in this folder are common, and for the current octa platform always onboard and available.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{platform}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
The platform sections consists of a common part and a part for each supported platform.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxyparagraph{common}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
The common platform has some common functions such as {\ttfamily Initialize\+\_\+\+Platform()}. This will in turn call the platform initialize function of the selected platform. For now, this common part is rather limited.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxyparagraph{octa}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
This is the original platform, consisting of a {\ttfamily Nucleo\+L496\+Z\+G-\/P} board, and the {\ttfamily octa-\/connect} expansion shield.\textbackslash{} Platform specific code for G\+P\+IO, U\+A\+RT, S\+PI, I2C, Watchdog Timers, Interrupts, Free\+R\+T\+OS schedulers, etc is found here. Furthermore, the platform specific startup files and linker scripts are here.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{ST}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
This section is for platform independent ST code\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{S\+T\+M32\+L4xx\+\_\+\+H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+Driver\+:}} The low level code of S\+T\+M32\+L4 boards
\item {\bfseries{Middlewares\+:}} The ST middlewares, mainly used for Free\+R\+T\+OS low level code
\item {\bfseries{C\+M\+S\+IS\+:}} The C\+M\+S\+I\+S-\/\+Free\+R\+T\+OS A\+PI
\item {\bfseries{S\+B\+S\+FU, S\+E\+Core\+Bin, S\+T\+M32\+\_\+\+Cryptographic, S\+T\+M32\+\_\+\+Secure\+\_\+\+Engine\+:}} Low level Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Update code of ST, used for the F\+O\+TA bootloader
\item {\bfseries{S\+T\+M32\+Cube\+Programmer\+:}} Binaries to flash an S\+T-\/\+Link device from the commandline, used for the {\ttfamily make flash-\/st} command
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{shields}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
The shields folder contains drivers for all kinds of pluggable shields such as sensor shields, communication shields etc.\textbackslash{} Every shield requires a header to be defined for it in the application makefile, as described in the \href{\#shield-definitions}{\texttt{ shield definitions}} section.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{applications}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
Some example applications are provided in this repo\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{hello-\/world}}\+: basic application, mainly to test the development environment setup.
\item {\bfseries{acc-\/mag-\/sensor}}\+: application using the accelerometer and magnetometer sensor on the octa.
\item {\bfseries{lightsensor}}\+: application using the lightsensor on the octa.
\item {\bfseries{temperature-\/humidity}}\+: application using the temperature \& humidity sensor on the octa.
\item {\bfseries{bootloader-\/minimal-\/example}}\+: application showing the minimal requirements for an application to be compatible with the S\+B\+S\+FU bootloader.

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Makefiles}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
The stack uses Makefiles, with each application having a {\ttfamily Makefile} for the application settings.\textbackslash{} This Makefile links to the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+core}, which will link to all the required makefiles of the drivers, shields and platforms.

The end user should only come into contact with the \href{\#application-makefile}{\texttt{ Application Makefile}}. If this file is set up correctly, the rest should be automated.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Application Makefile}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}
This file contains the high level settings of the application, such as the name, platform and the required shields.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{Application Name}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
The application name is defined as follows, and will end up being the name of the target binary.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# name of your application}
\DoxyCodeLine{APPLICATION = hello-\/world}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{Platform}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}
The platform is defined as follows, with currently only the main octa platform being supported.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# platform for which the application will be built}
\DoxyCodeLine{PLATFORM ?= octa}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{Float Support}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}
If floats have to be printed of sprinted, some extra libraries have to be included. To do this, {\ttfamily P\+R\+I\+N\+T\+\_\+\+F\+L\+O\+A\+TS} has to be set to 1.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Set PRINT\_FLOATS to 1 to enable linker flags enabling float printf \& sprintf}
\DoxyCodeLine{PRINT\_FLOATS = 1}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{Shield Definitions}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}
To use a shield in the application, the user has to define the name of the shield and a header connector in the application makefile. This connector number is passed to the code as a define using a -\/D parameter when compiling.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# SigFox}
\DoxyCodeLine{SHIELDS += SigFox}
\DoxyCodeLine{SIGFOX\_CONNECTOR = 1}
\end{DoxyCode}


An {\itshape O\+C\+T\+A\+\_\+header} struct will to be passed to the driver. This struct contains U\+A\+RT, I2C, S\+PI and G\+P\+IO Handles.\textbackslash{} These structs are defined during the platform initalization e.\+g. P1\+\_\+header, P2\+\_\+header, ...\textbackslash{} It is up to the shield driver to initialize the required handle with the driver\textquotesingle{}s specific settings.

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsubsection{Bootloader}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md16}
To use the F\+O\+TA S\+B\+S\+FU bootloader in the application, this has to be set in the {\ttfamily Makefile} as follows.\textbackslash{} Some bootloader specific code also has to be implemented in the application, shown in the {\itshape bootloader-\/minimal-\/example} application.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# use the SBSFU bootloader}
\DoxyCodeLine{BOOTLOADER ?= 1}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step Up Pin}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}
To enable or disable the step up pin, the {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+S\+T\+E\+P\+UP} variable has to be set to 1 or zero respectively. This will step up the battery voltage to 5V to the octa headers.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# enable the stepup pin}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENABLE\_STEPUP ?= 1}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsubsection{Link to core makefile}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md18}
Finally, the link to the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+core} has to be made.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Path to the octa-\/stack base directory:}
\DoxyCodeLine{STACKBASE ?= ../..}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{include \$(STACKBASE)/core/Makefile.core}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{Makefile.\+core}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md19}
The {\ttfamily Makefile.\+core} file is, as the name suggests, the core of every application.\textbackslash{} First of all, the link to the selected platform, drivers and shields makefiles made.\textbackslash{} After the source files, header files, startup files and linker script are defined, the code is compiled to {\ttfamily application-\/name.\+hex,bin,elf}.

Furthermore, {\ttfamily make flash} support is provided.\textbackslash{} Both {\ttfamily J-\/\+Link} and {\ttfamily S\+T-\/\+Link} are \href{\#make-command-overview}{\texttt{ supported}} by using {\itshape make flash-\/jlink} and {\itshape make flash-\/st} respectively.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsection{Makefile.\+platform}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}
In the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+platform} file, a check is done on the platform name of the application Makefile. If not valid, the make command will throw an error. If valid, the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+include} file of the common platform folder is included as well as the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+include} of said platform.\textbackslash{} This file sets some platform specific setting such as the {\itshape C\+PU} type, platform specific source and header files, startup file and linker scripts.

A {\itshape P\+L\+A\+T\+F\+O\+R\+M\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F\+I\+NE} define is also created, which is passed to the code in the {\ttfamily Makefile.\+core} file.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# platform define var, passed to code when compiling in Makefile.core}
\DoxyCodeLine{PLATFORM\_DEFINE += -\/D\$(addprefix platform\_,\$(PLATFORM))}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsection{Makefile.\+drivers}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md21}
The purpose of this file is to include every source and header file in the {\ttfamily core/drivers/$\ast$} folder.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{Makefile.\+shields}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md22}
This file will make sure that for every shield defined in the application {\ttfamily Makefile}, its {\ttfamily Makefile.\+include} file is included.\textbackslash{} These files contain the source and header files of each shield respectively. It also serves as a way to not having to include every shield driver in every application.
